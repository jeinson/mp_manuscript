This repository contains scripts used to perform analyses and generate figures for the manuscript Einson et. al 2023 *Genetic control of mRNA splicing as a potential mechanism for incomplete penetrance of rare coding variants*. It is generally organized as follows:

- The root directory contains scripts used to directly generate figures. 
- The `data` directory contains summary statistics that can be published. 
- the `scripts` directory and all subdirectories contain upstream processing code for generating data files used in scripts in the root directory. In general, these scripts begin with genotype data that requires access approval. 

This repository is continuously being updated, so if there's something you're looking for that you can't find, feel free to contact me at jeinson@nygenome.org.
